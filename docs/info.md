## How it works

A two bit full adder that takes 5 inputs and processes them through a series of and or and xor gates into 3 outputs.

## How to test

Attach some form of input to each of the five pins (preferably one that doesnt need to be contintually pressed) and connect 3 outputs (preferaby LEDS)

## External hardware

3 needed LEDs (the other 5 are optional just to visualize inputs), 8 pin dip switch
